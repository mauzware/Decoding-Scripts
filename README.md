## 🏁 CTF Scripts 🏁

<i>**This is a collection of decoding scripts I built during various CTF challenges.**

**Each script was inspired by real-world problems I encountered. The repository will be updated as new scripts are created.**

**Included decoders: ROT, Hex, Morse, Vigenere, RSA, XOR, etc.**</i>
